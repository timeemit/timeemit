        I was the first engineering hire of a Silicon Valley startup that now has a hundred other employees, incessant revenue growth from the Fortune 500 quarter after quarter, and four rounds of investment from prominent venture capital forms.  I have repeatedly developed mission-critical software that met lofty visions under tight deadlines since joining this company, Synack, three years ago.  Now with a head count just over a hundred, Synack, Inc. has won the CNBC Disruptor award two years in a row and made headlines with The New York Times and Forbes.  Synack is poised to dominate enterprise cyber security running most of its services off of code that I’ve designed, written, tested, and deployed both independently and on teams.

        I’ve performed all this work as a software engineer yet I hold no formal degree in computer science: my education is in mathematics and physics.  My engineering skillset is the result of a dedicated transition from academic physics through constant study of online resources and a passionate love for building out new ideas.  Four consecutive summer internships working in research labs sparked my interest in programming as I often wrote software to automate repetitive calculations and analysis of lab results.  I’ve since accrued my engineering prowess through an insatiable ingestion of resources that either fed my curiosity of software design or fueled my capacity to build a never-ending list of personal projects.  When it comes to software, I take the phrase “learning-by-doing” very seriously.
